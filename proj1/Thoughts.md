# Reflecting on Challenges and Committing to Better Practices for Project 2

One of the primary challenges when working with someone else's project is dealing with dependencies. Coordinating and configuring these dependencies to match the repository's requirements was a time-consuming and frustrating task. When we try to run a project just for testing, it really waste lots of time to solve the dependency problems. During the process of solving dependency installation, version conflicts and missing packages were common issues that required extensive troubleshooting.

Insufficient documentation is also a big hurdle when navigating unfamiliar codebases. The repository I was working with had some documentation, but I think it is not enough to figure out all the thing I need tothe code's structure, proper configuration, and the purpose of various components. This lack of guidance led to a substantial amount of trial and error, consuming valuable time and effort.

Another frustrating aspect was the lack of well-defined project objectives. Without a clear understanding of the code's intended purpose, it was challenging to assess whether it was running correctly or whether my modifications were aligned with the intended goals. For example, the project we work did not provide a very clear document to illustrate what they really want to do. 

Reflecting on these challenges, I have identified several practices that could have helped me avoid some of the difficulties associated with running someone else's GitHub code. Here's what I plan to do differently in Project 2:

To alleviate dependency management challenges, WI will establish a dedicated virtual environment for Project 2. Using some tools, like conda for Python,  ensure that we have the correct versions without affecting system-wide packages. This approach will simplify dependency management and mitigate version conflicts.

To eliminate confusion regarding project objectives, I will define and document clear goals and milestones at the project's outset. This structured approach will provide a roadmap for development, making it easier to evaluate whether the code aligns with its intended purpose.

Documentation will be a priority for Project 2. We will commit to documenting my code thoroughly, including comments, clear setup instructions, and explanations of each component's purpose. Robust documentation will not only assist me in understanding and maintaining the code but also benefit anyone else who interacts with it in the future.

Regular Maintenance:
Recognizing the importance of codebase maintenance, I will make it a practice to regularly update my code during Project 2. This proactive approach will help prevent compatibility issues with new libraries and frameworks, ensuring that the code remains up to date and accessible.

Effective Error Handling:
In Project 2, I will implement more robust error handling mechanisms. This includes providing informative error messages and clear steps for debugging common issues. Improved error handling will expedite problem identification and resolution, reducing frustration and wasted time.
